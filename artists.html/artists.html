        <h2>Katja Farin</h2>
        <p>
          Katja Farin is a painter based in Los Angeles whose work explores vulnerability, performance, and identity in the digital age. 
          Her portraits often reflect themes of emotional masking, gender fluidity, and anxiety, portrayed in surreal yet intimate compositions. 
          Drawing from Gen Z’s visual culture and layered references, her paintings question what’s real and what’s curated.

        <h2>Michael Armitage</h2>
        <p>
          Michael Armitage, born in Nairobi and trained in London, blends classical oil painting with East African contemporary themes. 
          His signature use of lubugo bark cloth links the modern to the ancestral, while his dreamlike yet political paintings address colonialism, 
          protest, and identity. Armitage’s work reclaims space for African narratives within Western art discourse.

        <h2>Zhang Daqian</h2>
        <p>
          One of China’s most influential artists of the 20th century, Zhang Daqian began as a classical ink painter but evolved into an expressive innovator. 
          After political exile, he pioneered “splashed-ink” techniques that fused tradition with abstraction. His works bridge dynastic reverence with modern freedom, 
          creating landscapes that feel both ancient and ephemeral.

        <h2>Njideka Akunyili Crosby</h2>
        <p>
          Njideka Akunyili Crosby is a Nigerian-born artist whose mixed-media paintings combine photo transfers, textiles, and painting to portray layered domestic scenes. 
          Her work explores cultural hybridity, postcolonial identity, and intimacy, blending Nigerian and Western iconography. Her pieces offer quiet, powerful reflections 
          on belonging, womanhood, and memory.

        <h2>About the Critic</h2>
        <p>
          Marc-Philipp Eichhorn is an emerging art critic and Georgetown University graduate with a passion for visual storytelling and cultural commentary. 
          Blending poetic insight with academic curiosity, he brings voice to the voiceless — imagining what paintings might say if they could speak.
